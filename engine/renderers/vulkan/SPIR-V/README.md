### SPIR-V Compiler

This is a modification of the entry point source for glslang's glslValidator to be able to compile GLSL into SPIR-V during runtime. The original source should be found under the StandAlone directory of the [Khronos glslang project](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) in case anyone needs to track it back.

Obviously, the same copyright terms apply for this folder as that of the original one, except for local changes which follow the Aeon Engine terms.
