# AeonEngine
Aeon Games Flagship Game Engine

This is the 3rd iteration of the engine, the first one was started circa 1996 and was lost on a hard drive crash, the second one was started circa 2001 and still exists, but is a mess and a patchwork of collected ideas of 15 years of trying to keep up.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
