It's been more than a year since I wrote one of these. I had found too many things I was not happy with, and many more I would have to refactor or reimplement.
Now I am getting back to the point where I was about 14 months ago, models load and display and soon they will animate again.

I want to start streaming some codding sessions on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXYUcBJLn5mc5KsMt8HBdw), so stay tunned for that.
