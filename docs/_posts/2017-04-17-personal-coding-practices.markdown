You may have noticed that I go back and forth changing code, then changing it back and then changing it again to what it was before. Usually this means I am working with some ideas or technologies that are new to me (Vulkan for example) and as such I do not yet have a good grasp of what I am doing. I could design everything on paper, write thousands of use cases and draw UML diagrams or as a University profesor of mine once said "to program it on MS Word". And indeed that would be the best practice if I was an architect on a team, but I am that and the whole team right now. If I was to design this engine "on paper" would double my work going back and forth changing the programmer hat for the architect hat, so I don't. But the main reason I wanted to write these words is to communicate something important. It doesn't matter how bad you think your code is, if you don't write it you'll never get anything done, so don't wait and start working on your prototypes.

That said, don't be closed minded or hardheaded, always listen to advice and try to follow standards, it won't do you any harm, and the good thing about advice is that you can choose what to keep and what to discard.
