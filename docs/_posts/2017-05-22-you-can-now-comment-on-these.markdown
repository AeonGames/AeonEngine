The title says it all.

You can now comment on these ramblings via disqus.

Yeah I know, it's been over a week since my last productive commit, so here is an update:

I've been working on the Blender UDK importer so I can render some ~~stolen~~ nice art imported from actual games. As such, my work is currently only on my computer. Once I am happy with the results, I'll try to push the updated importer into the official Blender addon source tree so everyone benefits. We'll see how that goes.

Anyway, comment bellow!.
