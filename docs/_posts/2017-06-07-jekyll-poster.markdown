I have added a new tool, [Jekyll Poster](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AeonGames/AeonEngine/master/tools/jekyllposter/jekyllposter.html), an offline html markdown editor to be able to easily create these posts.

It is currently rather crude, but beats using any old text application.

This post was made using it.
