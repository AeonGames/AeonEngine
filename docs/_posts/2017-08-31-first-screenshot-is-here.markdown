![Aerin just chilling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AeonGames/AeonEngine/master/docs/static/screenshots/aerin_idle.png)

So this finally is the first official in-engine screenshot, taken from the modelviewer application, this is "Aerin", shown in an idle pose.

The model and animations come from [Adobe's Fuse (formerly Mixamo)](https://www.mixamo.com/), though the slider settings are not the default (Fuse works like character creator from games such as Mass Effect or Fallout 4).

The Aerin name was chosen to match the **Ae** in **Ae**on Games, and the idea is to keep her as a character mascot for the brand, in that sense, the character becomes our trademark, while the actual assets copyright still belongs to Adobe.

In that regard, I would really like to add the asset files to the repo for everyone to experiment, but I am unclear as to what the legal implications would be. Fuse is currently free, and character models made with it may be freely used on video games, but this is a game engine, so while the assets I may publish are derivatives, they'll be freely accessible for modification which may not be something Adobe would allow or continue to allow in the future.

So, thats it! maybe I should record a video tutorial on exporting Fuse characters into the engine... or maybe morph the [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org/) mesh into Fuse's.
