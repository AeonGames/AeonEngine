        Windows we want the window to own its device context.
        This code works on Qt 5.6.0, but if it does not
        or a new non Qt application needs to set it,
        a window class style seems to be mutable by using
        SetClassLongPtr( ..., GCL_STYLE, ... );
        instead.

        This flag is Windows specific, so Linux or Mac implementations
        probably just ignore it, I have not verified this.
